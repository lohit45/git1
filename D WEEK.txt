
Week 1:

Days 1-2: Familiarize yourself with basic programming concepts such as variables, control statements, loops, functions, and recursion. Practice writing simple programs in your language of choice.

Days 3-5: Study and implement basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks. Practice implementing algorithms such as linear search and binary search.

Days 6-7: Study and implement basic algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort) and searching algorithms (e.g. linear search, binary search).

Week 2:

Days 8-10: Study and implement more complex data structures such as queues, trees, and graphs. Practice implementing algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search.

Days 11-12: Study and implement more advanced sorting algorithms such as merge sort and quicksort.

Days 13-14: Study and implement more advanced searching algorithms such as interpolation search and binary search trees.

Week 3:

Days 15-17: Study and implement dynamic programming techniques, which are used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.

Days 18-20: Study and implement greedy algorithms, which are used to solve optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step.

Days 21-22: Study and implement graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Week 4:

Days 23-24: Study and implement string algorithms such as Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and Rabin-Karp algorithm.

Days 25-27: Practice solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Focus on problems related to the topics you have studied so far.

Days 28-30: Review and practice implementing the concepts you have learned. Focus on understanding the time and space complexity of each algorithm and data structure.

Remember that this is just a plan, and you can adjust it according to your own pace and needs. The key is to practice regularly and focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than just memorizing code. Good luck
