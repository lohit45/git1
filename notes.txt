Introduction:



HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
content. Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented. 
HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language.
There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. These are called void elements. Void
elements include <img>, <meta>, <link> and <input>.



Elements: video, audio, table, footer
Tags: <video>, <audio>, <table>, <footer>, </html>, </body


Sample 1:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HELLO</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>HELLO world</h1>
<p>CHi po ra </p>
</body>
</html>


<pre> Defines pre-formatted text
